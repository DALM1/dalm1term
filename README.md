DALM1Term (INDEV)
Introduction
DALM1Term is a simple web application that allows users to execute terminal commands from their web browser. The application is built using Node.js and Express.js.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
To run DALM1Term, you need to have Node.js installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Node.js from the official website.

Installation
To install DALM1Term, follow these steps:

Clone the repository from GitHub: git clone https://github.com/DALM1/dalm1term.git

Change into the project directory:
``` 
cd dalm1term
```

Install the dependencies:
``` 
npm install
```  
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
create keys.py in the engshell directory to define OPENAI_KEY

Usage:
To use DALM1Term, follow these steps:

Start the application:
``` 
npm start
```
```  
npm run dev
```
```  
nodemon app.cjs
```
```
node app.cjs
```
python engshell.py 
```

Open your web browser and go to http://localhost:3000
Enter a command in the input field and "Execute"

The output of the command will be displayed in the output area below the input field.
How It Works
DALM1Term uses Express.js to handle HTTP requests and responses. When a user submits a command, the application uses the exec() function from the Node.js child_process module to execute the command in the terminal. The output of the command is then sent back to the user in the HTTP response.
